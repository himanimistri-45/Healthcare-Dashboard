Step 1: data structure understand
Columns:
  Blood_Type

  Medical_Condition

  Date_of_Admission

 Doctor

 Hospital

 Insurance_Provider

 Billing_Amount

 Room_Number

 Admission_Type

 Discharge_Date

 Medication

 Test_Results



Step 2: Basic Data 
SELECT * 
FROM Healthcare
LIMIT 10;
ðŸ‘‰ some rows see bcz data structure understand



step:3 Would you like me to also give you how to check missing/null values

SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN `Blood Type` IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Missing_BloodType,
    SUM(CASE WHEN `Medical Condition` IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Missing_Condition,
    SUM(CASE WHEN `Billing Amount` IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Missing_Billing,
    SUM(CASE WHEN `Test Results` IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Missing_TestResults
FROM healthcare_dataset_1000;
ðŸ‘‰ Identify columns with missing values




Step 4: Summary Statistics (Billing Amount)

SELECT 
    MIN(`Billing Amount`) AS Min_Billing,
    MAX(`Billing Amount`) AS Max_Billing,
    AVG(`Billing Amount`) AS Avg_Billing,
    SUM(`Billing Amount`) AS Total_Billing
FROM healthcare_dataset_1000;
ðŸ‘‰ Summary of Total Billing

Step 5: Number of Patients by Medical Condition

SELECT 
    `Medical Condition`, 
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Patients
FROM healthcare_dataset_1000
GROUP BY `Medical Condition`;
ðŸ‘‰Patients count per medical condition

Step 6: Patients by Admission Type

SELECT 
    `Admission Type`, 
    COUNT(*) AS Patients_Count
FROM healthcare_dataset_1000
GROUP BY `Admission Type`;
ðŸ‘‰ Patient count by Admission Type (Emergency, Urgent, Elective)


Step 7: Medication Analysis

SELECT 
    Medication, 
    COUNT(*) AS Usage_Count
FROM healthcare_dataset_1000
GROUP BY Medication
ORDER BY Usage_Count DESC;


Step 8: Test Results Analysis

SELECT 
    `Test Results`, 
    COUNT(*) AS Result_Count
FROM healthcare_dataset_1000
GROUP BY `Test Results`
LIMIT 0, 25;

ðŸ‘‰ Patient count by Test Result (Positive, Inconclusive)

Step 9: Doctor wise 

SELECT 
    Doctor, 
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Patients
FROM healthcare_dataset_1000
GROUP BY Doctor
ORDER BY Total_Patients DESC;

ðŸ‘‰ Patient count by Doctor

Step 10: Hospital-wise Billing

SELECT 
    Hospital, 
    SUM(`Billing Amount`) AS Total_Hospital_Billing,
    AVG(`Billing Amount`) AS Avg_Hospital_Billing
FROM healthcare_dataset_1000
GROUP BY Hospital
ORDER BY Total_Hospital_Billing DESC
LIMIT 0, 25;
DESCRIBE healthcare_dataset_1000;

ðŸ‘‰ Hospital-wise maximum billing

joins,subqueries,ranking

STEP:1 
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW healthcare_clean AS
SELECT
  `Name`  AS name,
  `Age`   AS age,
  `Gender` AS gender,
  `Blood Type` AS blood_type,
  `Medical Condition` AS medical_condition,
  STR_TO_DATE(`Date of Admission`,'%d-%m-%Y') AS date_of_admission,
  `Doctor` AS doctor,
  `Hospital` AS hospital,
  `Insurance Provider` AS insurance_provider,
  `Billing Amount` AS billing_amount,
  `Room Number` AS room_number,
  `Admission Type` AS admission_type,
  STR_TO_DATE(`Discharge Date`,'%d-%m-%Y') AS discharge_date,
  `Medication` AS medication,
  `Test Results` AS test_results
FROM healthcare;

=>>>>Create a clean view to tackle columns with spaces (OPTIONAL)

STEP:2 Joins (example)
2.1) Aggregate Subquery join (Hospital level averages)
The purpose: To attach each patientâ€™s row with their hospitalâ€™s average billing.

WITH hosp AS (
  SELECT hospital, COUNT(*) AS patients, AVG(billing_amount) AS avg_billing
  FROM healthcare_dataset_clean
  GROUP BY hospital
)
SELECT h.name, h.hospital, h.billing_amount, hosp.patients, hosp.avg_billing
FROM healthcare_dataset_clean h
JOIN hosp ON h.hospital = hosp.hospital
ORDER BY h.hospital, h.billing_amount DESC;



2.2) Self-Join (Patients who share the same doctor and the same medical condition (i.e., patient pairs with identical doctor & condition).)
SELECT a.name AS patient1, b.name AS patient2, a.doctor, a.medical_condition
FROM healthcare_dataset_clean a
JOIN healthcare_dataset_clean b
  ON a.doctor = b.doctor
 AND a.medical_condition = b.medical_condition
 AND a.name < b.name;   


2.3) Dimension-like join (Assign an urgency score to each admission type)
SELECT h.name, h.admission_type, s.urgency_score
FROM healthcare_dataset_clean h
JOIN (
  SELECT 'Emergency' AS admission_type, 3 AS urgency_score
  UNION ALL SELECT 'Urgent', 2
  UNION ALL SELECT 'Elective', 1
) AS s USING (admission_type)
ORDER BY urgency_score DESC;

3) Subqueries
Correlated Subquery:- Bills that are higher than the hospitalâ€™s average billing.)
SELECT name, hospital, billing_amount
FROM healthcare_dataset_clean h
WHERE billing_amount > (
  SELECT AVG(billing_amount)
  FROM healthcare_dataset_clean
  WHERE hospital = h.hospital
)
ORDER BY hospital, billing_amount DESC;

3.2) IN / EXISTS (All patients of doctors who have â‰¥2 Positive reports.)
SELECT *
FROM healthcare_dataset_clean
WHERE doctor IN (
  SELECT doctor
  FROM healthcare_dataset_clean
  WHERE test_results = 'Positive'
  GROUP BY doctor
  HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
);


3.3) Doctor-wise earliest admission (The first admission of each doctor.)
SELECT *
FROM healthcare_dataset_clean h
WHERE date_of_admission = (
  SELECT MIN(date_of_admission)
  FROM healthcare_dataset_clean
  WHERE doctor = h.doctor
);


4) Ranking (Window Functions)
4.1) Rank patients within each hospital based on billing. (Top-N per hospital)
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT 
    name, hospital, billing_amount,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY hospital ORDER BY billing_amount DESC) AS bill_rank
  FROM healthcare_dataset_clean
)
SELECT *
FROM ranked
WHERE bill_rank <= 3
ORDER BY hospital, bill_rank, billing_amount DESC;


4.2) Top Doctors by Total Billing (overall rank)
WITH doc AS (
  SELECT doctor, SUM(billing_amount) AS total_billing, COUNT(*) AS patients
  FROM healthcare_dataset_clean
  GROUP BY doctor
)
SELECT 
  doctor, total_billing, patients,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_billing DESC) AS rnk
FROM doc
ORDER BY rnk;

4.3) Length-of-Stay (LOS) & Rank (hospital wise)
SELECT
  name, hospital,
  DATEDIFF(discharge_date, date_of_admission) AS los_days,
  RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY hospital 
    ORDER BY DATEDIFF(discharge_date, date_of_admission) DESC
  ) AS los_rank
FROM healthcare_dataset_clean
ORDER BY hospital, los_rank;

5) Trend/CTEs (bonus)
5.1) Monthly admissions & billing by condition
SELECT 
  DATE_FORMAT(date_of_admission, '%Y-%m') AS ym,
  medical_condition,
  COUNT(*) AS admits,
  SUM(billing_amount) AS total_bill
FROM healthcare_dataset_clean
GROUP BY ym, medical_condition
ORDER BY ym, medical_condition;



5.2) Running total (month-wise)
WITH m AS (
  SELECT DATE_FORMAT(date_of_admission, '%Y-%m') AS ym,
         SUM(billing_amount) AS amt
  FROM healthcare_dataset_clean
  GROUP BY ym
)
SELECT 
  ym, amt,
  SUM(amt) OVER (ORDER BY ym 
                 ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
FROM m;


6) Data Quality checks (qucikly)
-- Age outliers
SELECT * FROM healthcare_clean WHERE age < 0 OR age > 120;

-- Missing dates
SELECT * FROM healthcare WHERE `Discharge Date` IS NULL OR `Discharge Date` = '';

-- Invalid negative billing
SELECT * FROM healthcare_clean WHERE billing_amount < 0;
