Step 1: data structure understand
Columns:
  Blood_Type

  Medical_Condition

  Date_of_Admission

 Doctor

 Hospital

 Insurance_Provider

 Billing_Amount

 Room_Number

 Admission_Type

 Discharge_Date

 Medication

 Test_Results



Step 2: Basic Data 
SELECT * 
FROM Healthcare
LIMIT 10;
ðŸ‘‰ some rows see bcz data structure understand



step:3 Would you like me to also give you how to check missing/null values

SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN `Blood Type` IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Missing_BloodType,
    SUM(CASE WHEN `Medical Condition` IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Missing_Condition,
    SUM(CASE WHEN `Billing Amount` IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Missing_Billing,
    SUM(CASE WHEN `Test Results` IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Missing_TestResults
FROM healthcare_dataset_1000;
ðŸ‘‰ Identify columns with missing values




Step 4: Summary Statistics (Billing Amount)

SELECT 
    MIN(`Billing Amount`) AS Min_Billing,
    MAX(`Billing Amount`) AS Max_Billing,
    AVG(`Billing Amount`) AS Avg_Billing,
    SUM(`Billing Amount`) AS Total_Billing
FROM healthcare_dataset_1000;
ðŸ‘‰ Summary of Total Billing

Step 5: Number of Patients by Medical Condition

SELECT 
    `Medical Condition`, 
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Patients
FROM healthcare_dataset_1000
GROUP BY `Medical Condition`;
ðŸ‘‰Patients count per medical condition

Step 6: Patients by Admission Type

SELECT 
    `Admission Type`, 
    COUNT(*) AS Patients_Count
FROM healthcare_dataset_1000
GROUP BY `Admission Type`;
ðŸ‘‰ Patient count by Admission Type (Emergency, Urgent, Elective)


Step 7: Medication Analysis

SELECT 
    Medication, 
    COUNT(*) AS Usage_Count
FROM healthcare_dataset_1000
GROUP BY Medication
ORDER BY Usage_Count DESC;


Step 8: Test Results Analysis

SELECT 
    `Test Results`, 
    COUNT(*) AS Result_Count
FROM healthcare_dataset_1000
GROUP BY `Test Results`
LIMIT 0, 25;

ðŸ‘‰ Patient count by Test Result (Positive, Inconclusive)

Step 9: Doctor wise 

SELECT 
    Doctor, 
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Patients
FROM healthcare_dataset_1000
GROUP BY Doctor
ORDER BY Total_Patients DESC;

ðŸ‘‰ Patient count by Doctor

Step 10: Hospital-wise Billing

SELECT 
    Hospital, 
    SUM(`Billing Amount`) AS Total_Hospital_Billing,
    AVG(`Billing Amount`) AS Avg_Hospital_Billing
FROM healthcare_dataset_1000
GROUP BY Hospital
ORDER BY Total_Hospital_Billing DESC
LIMIT 0, 25;
DESCRIBE healthcare_dataset_1000;

ðŸ‘‰ Hospital-wise maximum billing
